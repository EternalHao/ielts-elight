00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
thanks to Unreal for sponsoring this

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,279
video this is the unreal air a pair of

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,740
AR glasses that effectively lets you

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,840
watch content from your Android or your

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,320
iPhone on a giant

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,360
130 inch screen inside of the box we

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,100
have the carrying case your typical

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,260
documentation a couple of different nose

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,539
pads a light Shield cover that can give

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,699
you a more immersive experience and a

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,619
prescription lens frame just in case you

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,140
need it but here is the unreal air

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,159
itself and it looks pretty good given

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,840
all the tech that they were able to pack

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,660
in here it's actually not too far off

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,360
from a pair of regular sunglasses which

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,579
they were clearly inspired by obviously

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,100
They are thicker but surprisingly

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,899
they're not as heavy as I thought they

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,260
would be coming in at just 79 grams now

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,300
this is in part thanks to the unreal air

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,120
not having a built-in battery with the

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,160
glasses instead being powered completely

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,699
via USBC which for Android phones is no

25
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,620
problem you just plug it in and it

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,780
provides both power and mirrors whatever

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,760
is on your screen whereas with iPhones

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,460
up until now this wasn't really possible

29
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,220
but with the new Unreal adapter they

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,200
figured it out with it working perfectly

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,479
with Apple's AV Adapter letting you

32
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,299
mirror whatever is on your iPhone screen

33
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,119
at 130 inches but the big question of

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,939
course is how does it look right like

35
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,640
well the thought of having a 130 inch

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,220
screen anywhere you go sounds good on

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,439
paper we've heard claims like these with

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,720
VR headsets before where it's almost

39
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,820
always let down since they all have that

40
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,400
screen door effect where all you see is

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,759
just pixels with the unreal air however

42
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,320
there is none of that I was actually

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,840
blown away with how sharp it is there's

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,820
two micro OLED displays with a

45
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,000
resolution of 3840x1080 which across the

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,340
46 degree field of view gives you over

47
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,500
twice the pixels per degree compared to

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,479
something like the quest 2. now I'm not

49
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,060
saying that it's an 8K experience or

50
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,720
thing but it is a 1080p experience and

51
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,659
for watching videos and movies it's been

52
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,639
great especially if you pair them with a

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,258
good set of earbuds which just takes

54
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,420
things to the next level of course you

55
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,580
don't actually have to use earbuds with

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,560
these since they do have built-in

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,680
speakers on each arm which you know are

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
fine for things like YouTube videos but

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,400
if you really want that home theater

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,379
Vibe using these with earbuds is

61
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,599
definitely the way to go now the screens

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,220
themselves provide a perceived

63
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,099
brightness of up to 400 nits and

64
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,560
generally that's more than bright enough

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,239
for example you can't even see anything

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,980
behind the screen when you have white

67
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,560
displaying on it but with the darker

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,599
colors you do start to become aware of

69
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,580
your surroundings which is kind of the

70
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,800
point of AR glasses and we'll talk about

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,080
the AR specific applications in a little

72
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,180
but if you're just wanting to use these

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,160
as a giant screen and nothing more

74
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,840
putting the light Shield cover on this

75
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,819
gives you the most vibrant experience

76
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,140
since it doesn't have to compete with

77
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,000
the lights in your environment Okay so

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,580
it's really hard to demonstrate on

79
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,860
camera how this thing actually looks in

80
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,900
person since sticking a camera up close

81
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,640
to it creates a bunch of Reflections

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,959
that aren't really there when you wear

83
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,760
them and even then the sizing is

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,500
different from what you perceive with

85
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,180
your eyes so just for your reference

86
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,879
this is what a 55 inch TV looks like

87
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,099
from 13 feet away which matches the

88
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,680
perceived distance on the unreal air and

89
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,280
this is how big the 130 inch screen

90
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,879
actually looks so just giant now in

91
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,500
addition to being able to watch videos

92
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,080
on Netflix on Hulu and YouTube and all

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,819
those other streaming apps you can also

94
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,879
just mirror whatever is on your phone or

95
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,159
computer screen since these basically

96
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,099
act as a monitor meaning you can work on

97
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,799
Excel you can use Samsung's decks you

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,780
can connect it to your M series Mac or

99
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,400
you can just play games on your phone

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,680
which is even better when you connect a

101
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,840
controller to it since these also work

102
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,360
with Xbox game pass so some real

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,400
opportunities to take advantage of that

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,560
giant screen but beyond just using these

105
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,799
as a monitor or a TV unreal also has a

106
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,959
mixed reality mode through their nebula

107
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,060
app where you're in a 3D environment

108
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,340
with ar native content at the moment

109
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,739
this only works with Android phones and

110
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,540
you know there isn't a huge amount of

111
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,519
content just yet but one of the better

112
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,858
examples is the cycling app where you

113
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,060
can simulate what it's like to be

114
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,919
cycling or walking through a scenic

115
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,960
route while you're at home and on a

116
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,880
treadmill and interestingly in this

117
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,860
mixed reality mode you can make the

118
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,400
screen size even bigger at 201 inches

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,160
from a perceived six feet away which is

120
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,979
absolutely wild but you know for me the

121
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,040
main use case here is using it as a

122
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,800
giant display on the go the air stuff is

123
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000
cool and I'm sure it's going to get

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,040
better over time but just using these

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,780
around the house like when you're lying

126
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,060
in bed it's a game changer for example

127
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,800
if you're using it in bed at night you

128
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,660
get that big screen without blasting

129
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,520
light all over the room so if you have a

130
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
roommate or a partner you can actually

131
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,940
watch a movie without disturbing the

132
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,100
them while they're sleeping and on a

133
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,360
similar note if you're using it in

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,340
public spaces like on an airplane for

135
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,139
example it comes with the added benefit

136
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,360
of privacy where nobody else can

137
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
eavesdrop on what you're looking at on

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,840
your screen and then in those contexts

139
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,160
where you would otherwise be using your

140
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,660
phone for like a long period of time

141
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,520
this is a much more comfortable

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,919
experience since it's hands-free you

143
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,060
don't have to bend your neck down to

144
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,220
look at your screen and you can truly

145
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,160
just sit back and relax now that's not

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,199
to say that these are perfect well you

147
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,940
can use it as a second monitor for your

148
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,979
computer or for browsing the web because

149
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,580
we're talking about 1080p on a 130 inch

150
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,979
screen there is some pixelation around

151
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,380
text so I personally prefer using it

152
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,120
just for video although using it with

153
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,039
Samsung phones with Dex is pretty

154
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,600
awesome and then if you're moving around

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,220
a lot like when you're in a bumpy car

156
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,440
without the head tracking mode in the

157
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
nebula app like it would be with the

158
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,060
iPhone it could be a bit too shaky but

159
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,860
if you're sitting relatively still and

160
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,960
relaxed like on an airplane at the

161
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,520
doctor's office or just at home on the

162
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,300
couch

163
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,060
it's pretty good and it's easily the

164
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,680
best viewing experience I've had

165
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,560
compared to any other AR or VR headset

166
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,720
I've tried the unreal air comes in at

167
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,699
just

168
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:13,500
379 dollars which I don't think is too

169
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,120
bad considering it's Cutting Edge Tech

170
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,039
although if you have an iPhone the

171
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,320
unreal adapter and Apple's official AV

172
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,720
Adapter are sold separately you can now

173
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,940
buy it directly on Amazon with the

174
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,460
unreal error officially launching in the

175
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,440
US I'll be dropping all the links you

176
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,900
need Down Below in the description but

177
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,699
that's pretty much it for me in this

178
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,139
video big thanks to Unreal for

179
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,940
sponsoring it thank you guys for

180
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,720
watching and as always I'll see you in

181
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,560
the very next episode
