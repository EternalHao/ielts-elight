22
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,159
no what is that no worries let me tell

23
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,900
you guys all about it although we have

24
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,000
so many awesome productivity tools and

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,159
applications nowaday it can easily

26
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,560
become overwhelming and that's precisely

27
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,900
the issue which accuflow is looking to

28
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
fix it literally makes me feel like I

29
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,099
have multiple versions of myself

30
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,200
the idea is to create the ultimate time

31
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,659
blocking platform by consolidating all

32
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,760
the applications that you use and let

33
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,680
you block time for your tasks in just

34
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,720
one place the Integrations I've been

35
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,400
loving so far have been checking my

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,720
events and reminders from Google

37
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,940
Calendar my assigned development issues

38
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,980
from jira and even checking all of my

39
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,420
important due dates that I have on

40
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,159
notion also I really love when

41
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
applications develop command palettes

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,599
akiflow did a perfect implementation of

43
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,640
that so you can access all the features

44
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,260
you need with just a few keyword

45
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,420
shortcuts another feature I've been

46
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,400
using a lot is the availability sharing

47
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,380
which makes scheduling meetings a breeze

48
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,540
so you can say goodbye to the endless

49
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,298
back and forth emails

50
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,759
so overall Accu flow is a great tool for

51
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,440
anyone really who is looking to take

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,300
control of their time and boost your

53
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,979
productivity try it out today and see

54
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,840
for yourself thank you accuflow for

55
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,280
being a partner on this channel let's

56
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,780
get back to the video

57
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,580
all right so let's just get straight

58
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,620
into it and I'll start by showing you my

59
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,720
development environment which I just use

60
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,759
Visual Studio code and for the most part

61
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,199
I think I keep it pretty simple just

62
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,699
have a couple extensions that help with

63
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,380
formatting and a lot of language support

64
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,180
ones as well then for the terminal I

65
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,860
just use the integrated terminal most of

66
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,479
the time I just find it more convenient

67
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,400
to have there as opposed to opening up a

68
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,960
separate window so when I don't use the

69
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,419
integrated terminal with MBS code I use

70
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,419
item with power level 10K which is a zsh

71
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,520
theme do like that it shows cool things

72
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,820
like get and autocomplete on here

73
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,800
another tool that I use almost daily now

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,259
in vs code is GitHub co-pilot and I had

75
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,940
tried out the beta actually some time

76
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,320
back but then I was disappointed to

77
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,540
learn that it became a paid service but

78
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,220
for about 10 bucks a month I think it's

79
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,020
pretty hard to beat let me show you a

80
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,280
quick example of what you can do with

81
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,300
GitHub co-pilot

82
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,600
it usually just takes the context from a

83
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,580
comment or it looks at the code you had

84
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,020
previously written

85
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,639
and there you go look at how fast it

86
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,460
comes up with the solution

87
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,139
and that brings me to the next tool

88
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,759
which I've been using so much which is

89
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,580
chat GPT if you're not familiar it's an

90
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,320
artificial intelligence language model

91
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,419
that's been trained to answer all sorts

92
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,280
of questions from Tech related topics to

93
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,020
even personal advice it's able to

94
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,759
understand natural language and generate

95
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,380
responses that sounds like they were

96
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,900
written by human I've been using it for

97
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,400
so many things like writing and

98
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,080
responding to emails

99
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,680
coding project setups and system design

100
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,240
and even smaller things like asking it

101
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,740
for simple front-end design kind of

102
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,919
questions

103
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,660
actually pretty amazing stuff I even

104
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,699
added a cool new shortcut to use the

105
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,860
chat GPT Pro from any of my Apple

106
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,759
devices hey Siri run chat GPT shortcut

107
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,820
how to start a next JS project using

108
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,560
typescript

109
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,780
on it

110
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,539
xjs project using typescript you can

111
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,060
follow these steps one create a new

112
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,639
next.js next is notion which is actually

113
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,139
one of my favorite tools at the moment

114
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,720
is like an all-in-one workspace Way

115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,759
Beyond note taking which lets you do so

116
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,919
many cool things the way I've been using

117
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,139
notion is to keep track of all of my

118
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,180
development notes

119
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,580
for meetings such as stand-ups epic team

120
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,860
meetings and Sprint planning and keeping

121
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,500
a work log of all of my weekly issues

122
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,300
and I've been using notion for Beyond

123
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,979
software development I even keep track

124
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,840
of my clients for my site photography

125
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,680
business

126
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,419
and even to manage my YouTube videos

127
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,639
that I've been planning out so the next

128
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,500
food that I've been using is figma figma

129
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,479
is a powerful design tool that allows me

130
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,160
to create and collaborate on user

131
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,500
interface and other design assets I

132
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,120
appreciate the ability to work with my

133
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,220
team in real time and collaborate on

134
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,560
things like Design Systems prototyping

135
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,259
and creating mockups figma has really

136
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,180
accelerated my workflow as a full stack

137
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,560
engineer since you have to work pretty

138
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,720
quickly sometimes and figma has been

139
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,400
more than just web design for me I even

140
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,780
use it to manage all of my YouTube

141
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,759
content from things like thumbnails

142
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,819
Graphics to captions and titles and so

143
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,560
much more really I would encourage

144
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,840
anyone to pick up on figma even if

145
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,220
you're not working with web development

146
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,620
it's really an all-in-one tool for

147
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,660
anything design related

148
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,940
the bonus two I'm going to throw in is

149
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,400
the arc browser Arc is a new browser

150
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,620
which looks to improve and restructure

151
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,840
the way browsers are laid out I feel

152
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,520
like the arc browser gives me the clean

153
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,919
feel of safari with their power features

154
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,199
of chrome like extensions and chrome

155
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,479
developer tools which I always have open

156
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,940
when I'm doing web development Mark also

157
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,740
has a pretty neat onboarding which

158
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,840
leaves you with a cool custom sticker at

159
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,400
the end but it's still in development

160
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,900
and I don't think it's publicly

161
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,759
available yet here's a code if you want

162
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,919
to try it out

163
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:14,880
last but not least I want to mention

164
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,099
Excalibur which is an open source

165
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,780
web-based tool that allows you to create

166
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,240
diagrams and other visual assets quickly

167
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,400
and easily I used it a lot back when I

168
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,259
was on the Lee code grind as a

169
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,300
whiteboarding tool to help sketch out

170
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,099
and solve data structure and algorithm

171
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,740
problems so there you have it those were

172
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,539
just a few of my favorite and kind of

173
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,399
General tools that help me as a software

174
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,020
developer whether you're an experienced

175
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,159
developer or just starting out there's

176
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,020
always cool new things to learn oh and

177
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,279
let me know down in the comments if you

178
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,958
have any other tools you'd recommend for

179
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,560
me to try out

180
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,580
