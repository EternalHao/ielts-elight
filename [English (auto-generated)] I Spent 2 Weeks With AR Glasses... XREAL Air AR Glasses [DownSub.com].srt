1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
I've been struggling to find a way to

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,140
explain what this product is how it

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,120
works and why you should potentially

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,160
keep your eye on them not because

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,139
they're bad or not interesting by any

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,780
means in fact the quite opposite this

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,860
has got to be one of the most

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,660
interesting things that I've ever had a

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,460
chance to take a look at on this YouTube

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,520
channel these unassuming glasses allow

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,740
you to achieve both in augmented reality

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,380
and virtual reality experience anywhere

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,820
you go with up to a 201 inch 1080p OLED

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,859
display it's actually kind of

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,960
unbelievable before we go further though

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,239
I do want to thank xreel for sending

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,219
these out and sponsoring this video and

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,200
allowing me to take a look at what is

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,899
now probably one of my favorite pieces

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,360
of tech that being said though and to be

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,520
clear everything in this video that I

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,100
talk about is my opinion and my opinion

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,860
alone so hit that like button subscribe

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,420
to the channel and let's get right into

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,940
it just to clear some air here no pun

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,320
intended you might have seen these

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,600
before under a different name and unreal

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,120
this is the same product and the same

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,159
brand you can trust however they've

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,979
rebranded themselves to xreel anyways I

31
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,360
think it's important to take a look at

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,860
these from the outside in because

33
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,260
there's just so much to talk about and I

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,939
don't want anyone getting lost along the

35
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,220
way these look like your typical pair of

36
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,260
sunglasses they even come with a nice

37
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,560
carrying case a few extra Bridge sizes a

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,720
microfiber cloth a prescription lens

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,820
frame and pretty much everything that

40
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,040
you'd expect from sunglasses but when

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,500
you look deeper there's a USB C to C

42
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,460
cable a blackout cover and wait what's

43
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,880
this each lens has its own display this

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,140
is where things start to get a little

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,360
funky because when you put on the xreel

46
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,280
air you're able to see right through

47
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,500
them as you would with a regular pair of

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,720
glasses but the second that you connect

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,939
them to a phone or a device like a

50
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,820
laptop a games console or my favorite

51
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,460
the steam deck you'd see it come to life

52
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,680
now it is quite hard to explain to you

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,200
what exactly the these look like in real

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
life so I'm gonna have to do my best

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,500
with showing you video through the

56
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,380
lenses but if there's an analogy that I

57
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,880
can give you that will help with this

58
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,940
just picture this it's like having a

59
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,920
floating display a few feet away from

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,739
you a very large display at that all the

61
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,760
way from 130 inches to 201 inches it

62
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,379
really does feel like the content that

63
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,599
you're watching is in the room in a

64
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,520
sense now you're probably thinking to

65
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,040
yourself how is this practical well

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,840
because there's head tracking and you

67
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,879
also have a virtual reality environment

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,739
which we'll get to there's a lot that

69
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,660
you can do and the possibilities with

70
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,120
these are kind of Limitless one way that

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,860
I've used them is while sitting at my

72
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,080
desk to watch TV I'm doing other things

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,000
like script writing when I want to take

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,739
a look at what's going on I turn my head

75
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,720
to the side catch up with what's going

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,000
on in the show look forward and just get

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,459
right back to work another example is if

78
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,080
you're following a recipe in the kitchen

79
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,060
you can watch a cooking video whilst

80
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,099
you're actually cooking and be able to

81
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,840
see what you're doing doing without a

82
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,940
problem and follow along just by moving

83
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,459
your head I like the TV example because

84
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,459
for me I find it very difficult to have

85
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,800
a ton of things going on at once so if I

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,540
put up a YouTube video while I'm on my

87
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,580
computer it's very hard for me to focus

88
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,920
because of my ADHD so being able to kind

89
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,200
of have it off to the side and out of

90
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,120
view just allows me to do two things at

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
once without getting too much in my head

92
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,140
though I will be honest I will be lying

93
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,239
if I said that I didn't mostly use them

94
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,920
with my steam deck to play some video

95
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,780
games there's just something about

96
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,459
laying on the couch putting on the

97
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,260
blackout cover and experiencing games

98
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,840
like dead cells in what quite literally

99
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,239
feels like a movie theater what's also

100
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,040
nice is that there's speakers built in

101
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,840
so there's no need to grab a pair of

102
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,700
earbuds or headphones to be able to make

103
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,220
this a complete experience and they do

104
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,500
sound really good for what they are I've

105
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,540
had no complaints when watching TV or

106
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,760
playing video games and even listening

107
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,680
to music through them considering how

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,200
small these drivers must be I'm actually

109
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,760
really happy with the sound that comes

110
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,980
out of them before we dive into the VR

111
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,080
space though there is something that I

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,340
thought was going to be an issue with

113
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,720
these that I ended up just being

114
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,580
completely wrong about and that's

115
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,560
Comfort when I first saw these months

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,780
ago well before xreel even reached out

117
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,640
to me to take a look at these I thought

118
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,858
that they'd be cumbersome heavy and just

119
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,139
not pleasing to wear at all for any

120
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,600
extended period of time and I'm just

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,520
happy to say that I was completely wrong

122
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,759
firstly these things only weigh 79 grams

123
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,560
and when you consider the amount of tech

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,479
inside them it's actually really

125
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,520
impressive one thing keeping the weight

126
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,259
down though is the fact that there's no

127
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,880
internal battery they're powered by

128
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,160
whichever device you're connecting to so

129
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,080
that's something to keep in mind as your

130
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,520
usage and the time that you spend

131
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,740
wearing them will just depend on the

132
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,300
battery life of whatever it's connected

133
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,160
to I haven't found this to be a problem

134
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,960
on the devices that I've used but if you

135
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,639
do have a phone with a less efficient

136
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,580
chip or just a smaller battery just be a

137
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,560
little bit more mindful they also stay

138
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,080
on my head quite well and really do just

139
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,600
feel like I'm wearing sunglasses is like

140
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,280
like it doesn't really feel like

141
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,960
anything's getting in the way or that

142
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,580
I'm wearing something that I shouldn't

143
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,520
which is really nice because if you do

144
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,900
want to wear these for an extended

145
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,360
period of time you just don't really

146
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,280
have to think about it one thing that

147
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,960
did help though was the three Bridge

148
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,639
adjustments that came inside of the

149
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,740
packaging I ended up actually choosing

150
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,960
the largest one I believe as I just felt

151
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,520
it was the most comfortable on my face

152
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,620
and I'm happy that I was given the

153
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,900
option something like this cannot and

154
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,780
should not be a one size fits all so I'm

155
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,400
just really happy that this is something

156
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,560
that they thought about there are also

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,820
physical buttons for brightness

158
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,860
adjustment and one to turn the screen

159
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,199
off and on at first I was a little

160
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,120
confused as to how I'm able to turn the

161
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,340
volume up but I realize I'm just not

162
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,259
very smart because you can adjust it on

163
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,479
whatever device is connected but not

164
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
only that it turns out there is actually

165
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,919
a way just by holding the brightness key

166
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,199
for three seconds then you are able to

167
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,759
change the volume through the glasses

168
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,740
themselves moving on though what I

169
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,120
really want to talk about is the

170
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,520
augmented reality capabilities of the

171
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,740
xreel air because this is where things

172
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,080
get mind-blowing having a large display

173
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,180
at your disposal is quite amazing

174
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,160
especially if you're traveling or want

175
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,320
to keep what you're watching private but

176
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,600
if you have a compatible smartphone you

177
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,759
can use the nebula app which turns your

178
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,039
phone into a motion controlled and touch

179
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,500
sensitive remote not only that but the

180
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,900
glasses themselves open up a whole new

181
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,639
world of possibilities from a

182
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,620
full-fledged web browser with the

183
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,479
ability to place multiple tabs in

184
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,819
different areas apps for social media

185
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,759
like Twitter Youtube and even games this

186
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,919
is called their AR space and it's

187
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,259
actually incredible like I said these

188
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,259
glasses have two 1080p OLED displays and

189
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,139
they're running at 60 hertz so it

190
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,460
essentially tricks your mind into

191
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,020
thinking there's actual depth between

192
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,720
the content and you as well as other

193
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,120
content or apps and windows this is

194
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,319
something that I really cannot

195
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,419
demonstrate as any screen recordings

196
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,039
won't show you how this looks in real

197
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,020
life but if you've ever used a VR

198
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,000
headset you know what to experience

199
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,740
another thing that I want to show off

200
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,419
quickly though is that you can use the

201
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,400
nebula for Mac app to get a triple

202
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,979
monitor setup literally anywhere via one

203
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,919
USBC cable that's included in the box so

204
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,780
if you're on a plane or away from home

205
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,940
for extended periods I can see these

206
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,400
being very practical to get actual work

207
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,620
done the major difference to this in

208
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,080
just any other VR headset though is the

209
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,900
portability the accessibility and the

210
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,280
choice between using it with the

211
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,039
blackout cover on or off it really feels

212
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,500
like you're living in this weird AR VR

213
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,380
smart home kind of thing and it's just

214
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,840
really cool all of this heavily reminds

215
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,060
me of something like ready player one I

216
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,860
just can't believe this Tech is actually

217
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,259
something that does exist one thing that

218
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,759
I've learned though with my time spent

219
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,860
with the xreel air is that these aren't

220
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,660
a gimmick and these can be really

221
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,759
functional in your everyday life they're

222
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,220
great for gaming watching movies YouTube

223
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,800
and a vast amount of other things it's

224
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,139
really up to you to best figure out how

225
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,240
you can utilize them anyways I hope you

226
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,099
all enjoyed this video thank you so much

227
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,080
to xreel for allowing me to make this

228
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,960
video and try these out to be honest I'm

229
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,759
kind of sad that I have to give these

230
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,740
back because they're a lot of fun and I

231
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,300
really do want to mess around with them

232
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,220
a little bit more but

233
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,379
I'll catch you in the next one peace
